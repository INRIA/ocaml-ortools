# OCaml interface to Google OR-Tools

**Currently only a subset of CP-SAT is supported.**

[Pull requests](https://github.com/inria/ocaml-ortools/pulls) providing the 
missing features are welcome, but please pay attention to documentation and 
tests.

This project provides two packages:

* `ortools` is an OCaml interface for building CP-SAT models. It does not 
  require an installation of OR-Tools as it simply works with the protocol 
  buffer format. See `utils/sat_solve_pb.{c,py}` for examples of interfacing 
  with the CP-SAT solver.

* `ortools_solvers` builds on `ortools` to provide a simple OCaml interface 
  for calling CP-SAT. This package builds its own version of OR-Tools and, 
  on Linux, the libraries abseil, re2, protobuf, and protobuf-c.

```
opam install ocamlfind ortools_solvers
ocamlfind ocamlopt -o cp_is_fun_sat.exe \
            -package ortools_solvers -linkpkg \
            samples/sat/cp_is_fun_sat.ml
./cp_is_fun_sat.exe
```

## TODOs

* Finish migrating OR-Tools `sat/samples`

* Use `alcotest` to test the interface.
